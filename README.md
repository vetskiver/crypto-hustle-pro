# CryptoInfo

## Description

CryptoInfo is a web application designed to display comprehensive information about cryptocurrencies, including their value, market capitalization, and percentage change in value. The application leverages API calls to fetch real-time data about various cryptocurrencies. Users can search for specific coins, view a list of cryptocurrencies, and access detailed market cap data for the top cryptocurrencies.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency List:** Users can view a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, including their images, names, and current prices in USD.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar allows users to find specific cryptocurrencies by their symbol.
- **Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by Market Cap:** Displays the top 10 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization in USD on a separate pane.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The app fetches and updates data dynamically using API calls to ensure the information is current.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface, managing state, and handling dynamic content updates.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For API interactions, handling user inputs, and updating the UI.
- **CryptoCompare API:** For retrieving cryptocurrency data, including prices, market caps, and other relevant metrics.

## How It Works

1. **View Cryptocurrency List:**
   - Users can see a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, with each entry showing the cryptocurrencyâ€™s image, name, and price in USD.

2. **Search for Cryptocurrencies:**
   - A search bar allows users to filter the list of cryptocurrencies by their symbol, making it easy to find specific coins.

   - The data is retrieved using the CryptoCompare API and displayed dynamically.
